*Work in progress*

This md file will be used to describe the project.

In the meantime it can be used between the team to communicate dashboard design and how to navigate the project.

Tutorial on how modules work:
- see Dev/Modules Example.pptx

Example of a module written before being put into main app production:
- app_module_example.R
- followed by this module being piped into the main app and the design kit formatting the input features; see module_summary_dataset_coverage

Example of modules written and put into main so far:
- module_summary_dataset_coverage
- module_summary_dataset_overview
- module_summary_dataset_completeness

Remember that if you are using the global variables in a module to add them as arguments in the module server. See Modules Example.pptx.
